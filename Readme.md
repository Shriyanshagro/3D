Assignment under Graphics Course

Story of motivation:
There's dnahb_man need to reach the diagonally end point of land from starting point.

Rules and controls:

    To play the game:
        run the file sample2D in terminal , just by typing ./sample2D in terminal.

    To compile the code , run
        sudo g++ -o sample2D Sample_GL3_2D.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lGLEW -lglut -lm -lsfml-audio

    Controls:

        dnahb_man's control:
            a ==> left move
            d ==> right move
            w ==> up move
            s ==> down move

        Screen control:
            arrow_key_UP ==> zoom in
            arrow_key_DOWN ==> zoom out
            arrow_key_LEFT ==> panx increnment
            arrow_key_RIGHT ==> panx decrement


    Some twists in game:

        * You only have single life, to complete the game .
        * there's a trappy holes(black cloured) , if anyhow your dnahb_man ever try to cross from over it, you gotta lose you life in a jiff!!
